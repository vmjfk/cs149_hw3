report on homework 3 - process synchronization and pthreads. 


I found that the biggest challenge of this project was working in C in a modular fashion. 

The use of pointers and memory allocation provided ample segmentation faults and aborts. 


Once past those, the challenge became using a centralized clock to let the threads work 

together. the critical region in this project was the sell_seat function, which needed a 

mutext to prevent overwriting of the seatmap. The mutext waiting time made a number of 

customers wait too long to get tickets in some cases. 

Please see attached code and output.
